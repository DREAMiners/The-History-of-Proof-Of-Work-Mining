1) Genesis block - Satoshi Nakamoto & Bitcoin mining
1a) Satoshi quotes about mining
1b) Why proof of work? mining profit driven vs support of the project you believe in
2) Bitcoin Blockchain Growth      transactions, size, hashrate, pools, adoption 
3) Difficulty adjustment 
3a) Merged mining 
3b) Dual mining
3c) Mining Pools 
3d) Transactions fees
4) 51%, selfish mining and other attack vectors, a cost of 1h of POW mining attack on given network 
4a) Premined coins
5) From CPU mining to ASIC 
5a) Solar power, hydroelecrity, air cooling in Iceland
6) On-chain scaling vs off-chain (colored coins, LN, Plasma, payment channels, sidechains)
6a) Cloud Mining 
6b) Nicehash 
6c) 6GPU -> 12/13 GPU -> 19/20 PCIe Motherboards
7) GPU overclocking bios editing, undervolting 
8) Mining Ban (....China 2017, Venezuela 2018 ....)
9) FPGA in 2018 and how the history repeats itself
10) Mining profitability calculators and blockchain explorers
11) Different mining strategies (most profitable vs accumulate high number of coins at initial phase vs nicehash)
12) Who controls bitcoin? 13a) UASF, flags etc
13) Chain Splits/Forks
14) ASIC algorithms: SHA-256, Scrypt, X11, BLAKE (2b), QUARK, QUBIT, MYR-GROESTL, SKEIN, LBRY, BLAKE (14r), PASCAL, X11 GHOST, CRYPTONIGHT (GPU->ASIC history)
15) GPU algorithms: ETHASH GROESTL PHI1612 CRYPTONIGHT, CRYPTONIGHTv7, EQUIHASH, LYRA2REv2, NEOSCRYPT, TIMETRAVEL10, X16R, SKUNHASH, NIST5, XEVAN
16) Multi-algorithm coins
17) Competitive advantage (OhGodAnETHlargementPill, Asic boost etc)
18) Mining software, dedicated distros
19) Windows vs Linux mining, drivers, stability, hashrates, handy cripts, remote monitoring and security
19) ProgPoW - Programmatic Proof-of-Work and ASIC resistance
20) Blockchain vs DAG
98) extras: POS mining, social mining (apps- LIT, bit.tube)
99) References - each chapter should contain references at the bottom
